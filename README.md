A simple script to recover lost mnemonic words.
Works with Bitcoin Chia Etherum DogeCoin and much more!

How to use:
    1. Copy repository
    2. Edit the "run.py" file and enter your mnemonic(replace a missing word with '?')
    3. Install all the dependencies(you can use 'pip install mnemonic' instead)
    4. Run the script from the command prompt or terminal using 'python run.py'
